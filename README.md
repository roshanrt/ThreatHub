CyberShield is an advanced cybersecurity platform designed to revolutionize threat intelligence and detection engineering. It leverages AI and automation to streamline the extraction of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), map Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and generate actionable security content such as Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules.

ðŸŽ¯ What We Aim to Do:
Automate the ingestion and analysis of threat intelligence reports (PDF, JSON).

Extract and visualize IOCs and TTPs using advanced NLP and AI models.

Predict emerging TTP trends to proactively strengthen defenses.

Provide a SOC Copilot powered by AI for real-time analyst support and faster decision-making.

Automatically generate and export security detection rules for popular security tools.

Deliver interactive dashboards and comprehensive PDF reports to simplify threat analysis.

CyberShield empowers security teams to reduce manual effort, improve threat detection accuracy, and respond to cyber threats faster and more effectively.
